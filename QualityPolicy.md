### Quality Policy
> To ensure quality is adhered to, team members will meet 3 times a week in a standup. If unable to attend a detailed
> message on progress will be sent to the Scrum Master in the _standup channel. During the brief standup meeting, team
> members will let the SM know of progress, impediments, and an estimated completion time. SM will go over the Scrum
> Board to ensure it is updated before signing off. Team members are expected to be transparent about progress. 
> Team members are expected to make incremental progress and complete ~2 CR's w/ meaningful comments and checklist per sprint,
> ~500 lines of code per sprint, 5 tasks per sprint, no more than 1-2 tasks at once, update taiga SB witch progress,
> and communicate with the team. Team will adhere to a rigid tree structure for managing the remote repo.

**GitHub Workflow** (start Sprint 1)
  > 1. Team member will review Sprint backlog US's.
  > 2. Team member will choose task and then move it to "In-Progress".
  > 3. Team member will fetch latest master and navigate to the US# branch.
  > 4. If no task branch exists for their task number they will checkout and create one.
  > 5. Team member will work on task to completion, and commit the changes with the proper subject line. "US# Task# description"
  > 6. Upon completion, they will rebase their code with the US# they are working on and resolve conflicts.
  > 7. Before merging with the US# they will ensure it compiles and passes Unit Tests. Update Scrum Board.
  > 8. Team member will switch to the US# branch and merge the task with the US# branch and ensure it compiles. 
  > 9. Team member will assign someone to do a CR if applicable and update the _git channel on slack of progress.
  > 10. If all tasks are complete and AC's are fulfilled a PR will be made to merge the US# with the dev branch. Update Scrum Board. (git rebase -i to squash commits)
  > 11. Another team member will review changes on the protected dev branch and leave a detailed CR.
  > 12. Process will repeat until sprint ends or all US's are finished. Whichever happens first.
  > 13. Team member will update the Deliverable1.md document as needed.
  > 14. Upon Sprint completion Git Master and Scrum Master will merge the dev and doc to the master.

## Collaboration Policy: (TBD)
> In the event 2 or more team members are working on features that interact with each other
  > 1.Team members will notify the Scrum Master (SM) and the team in Discord when their tasks involve interacting features. 
  > 2.A brief discussion will be held during the standup or planning session to outline dependencies, shared responsibilities, and integration points(IE: Person A is reworking a feature that has dependencies and should expect certain features to not work until the task is finished.
  > 3.If 2 or more members are working on a feature, both members should communicate and coordinate commits and merges to ensure smooth changes and prevent and conflicts before merging.
  > 4.If a conflict occurs during a commit, both team members will need to coordinate and resolve conflicts collaboratively to ensure application functionality.
  > 5. Once dependent features are done and no conflicts exist, notify the Scrum Master to complete the tasks.
