### Quality Policy
> To ensure quality is adhered to, team members will meet 3 times a week in a standup. If unable to attend a detailed
> message on progress will be sent to the Scrum Master in the _standup channel. During the brief standup meeting, team
> members will let the SM know of progress, impediments, and an estimated completion time. SM will go over the Scrum
> Board to ensure it is updated before signing off. Team members are expected to be transparent about progress.
> Team members are expected to make incremental progress and complete ~2 CR's w/ meaningful comments and checklist per sprint,
> ~500 lines of code per sprint, 5 tasks per sprint, no more than 1-2 tasks at once, update taiga SB witch progress,
> and communicate with the team. Team will adhere to a rigid tree structure for managing the remote repo. Team members
> will test their own code before PR with UI testing and unit testing.

**GitHub Workflow** (start Sprint 1)
> 1. Team member will review Sprint backlog US's.
> 2. Team member will choose task and then move it to "In-Progress".
> 3. Team member will fetch latest master and navigate to the US# branch.
> 4. If no task branch exists for their task number they will checkout and create one.
> 5. Team member will work on task to completion, and commit the changes with the proper subject line. "US# Task# description"
> 6. Upon completion, they will rebase their code with the US# they are working on and resolve conflicts.
> 7. Before merging with the US# they will ensure it compiles and passes Unit Tests. Update Scrum Board.
> 8. Team member will switch to the US# branch and merge the task with the US# branch and ensure it compiles.
> 9. Team member will assign someone to do a CR if applicable and update the _git channel on slack of progress.
> 10. If all tasks are complete and AC's are fulfilled a PR will be made to merge the US# with the dev branch. Update Scrum Board. (git rebase -i to squash commits)
> 11. Another team member will review changes on the protected dev branch and leave a detailed CR.
> 12. Process will repeat until sprint ends or all US's are finished. Whichever happens first.
> 13. Team member will update the Deliverable1.md document as needed.
> 14. Upon Sprint completion Git Master and Scrum Master will merge the dev and doc to the master.

## Collaboration Policy: (TBD)
> In the event 2 or more team members are working on features that interact with each other
> 1. Team members will notify the Scrum Master (SM) and the team in Discord when their tasks involve interacting features.
> 2. A brief discussion will be held during the standup or planning session to outline dependencies, shared responsibilities, and integration points(IE: Person A is reworking a feature that has dependencies and should expect certain features to not work until the task is finished.
> 3. If 2 or more members are working on a feature, both members should communicate and coordinate commits and merges to ensure smooth changes and prevent and conflicts before merging.
> 4. If a conflict occurs during a commit, both team members will need to coordinate and resolve conflicts collaboratively to ensure application functionality.
> 5. Once dependent features are done and no conflicts exist, notify the Scrum Master to complete the tasks.


**Unit Tests Blackbox** (start Sprint 2)
> Blackbox testing will test API module main methods for good JSON format.
> Team member will ensure information is properly stored in models.
> Team members will ensure client can access these fields.
> Team member will construct mock objects with Mockito to ensure
> Will use proper assert statements to check state

**Unit Tests Whitebox** (online: start Sprint 2, campus: start Sprint 3)
> BVA and 80% node coverage, 60% branch coverage
> Whitebox testing will test API module main methods for good JSON format.
> Team member will ensure information is properly stored in models.
> Team members will ensure client can access these fields.
> Team member will construct mock objects with Mockito to ensure
> Will use proper assert statements to check state
