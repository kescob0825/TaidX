- **Git Master**: Jedi

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3):
Fill out your Sprint Planning here, based on the kickoff document and your team's discussions.

#### Sprint Goal:
- **Sprint Goal**: Further enhance and expand the types of API calls made and add UI enhancements.

#### Product Backlog & Sprint Backlog:
- **User Stories in Product Backlog**: 3
- **User Stories in Sprint Backlog**: 5

#### Sprint Planning Questions:
- **Why did you select these User Stories for this Spring?**
  > These were logically the next in development, Login and user information needed to be pulled in order to be able to call stats and other information.

#### Sprint Planning Questions:
- **Why do you think you can complete them in this Sprint?**
  > We don't think we can complete the entire backlog of US's, but we wanted enough tasks with different skill sets to allow everyone a chance to contribute

- **How do these User Stories align with the Sprint Goal?**
  > They all enhance the UI and the API allow the client to call and gather all needed information

- **Do you have a clear idea of the tasks needed to complete these User Stories? (If not, please notify via Slack.)**
  > Yes and if things are not clear we will call a design meeting.

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review (Answer as a team)
#### Screen Cast Link:  
- _Insert the link to your Sprint review screencast here._

#### Sprint Review Questions:
- **What value did you create during this Sprint?**
    > For this sprint, we implemented the UI for multiple aspects of the Memoranda project to align with 
      the Taiga website. We successfully integrated data from Taiga into several UI components, ensuring 
      that the displayed information accurately reflects the data from the API. Overall, we met our sprint 
      goal by expanding the variety of API calls used and enhancing the UI for better user experience.

- **Do you feel you worked enough and met expectations?**
    > Yes, as a group, we collaborated effectively to ensure that all user stories and tasks were Completed.
      We also verified that each component functioned as intended, meeting expectations for this sprint.

- **Did you meet the customers’ expectations? Why or why not?**
    > Yes, we believe we met the customers’ expectations for this sprint. Our goal was to further implement 
      and enhance the necessary API calls and UI components, which we successfully completed.

---

### Sprint Retrospective (Answer as a team, based on evidence)
Provide clear answers based on your team’s actual data and performance.

- **Did you meet your Sprint Goal?**
    > Yes, we met our sprint goal by expanding the variety of API calls used and enhancing the UI for better user experience.

- **Did you complete all User Stories in the Sprint Backlog?**
    > No, there are still 3 User Stories in the Sprint Backlog that we were unable to complete.

- **If not, what went wrong?**
    > We underestimated the time required to implement the UI and expand the API calls. Despite this, 
      we successfully completed 5 User Stories, totaling 23 tasks, which allowed us to meet our Sprint Goal 
      even with the remaining items in the backlog.

- **Did you work at a consistent rate or velocity?**
    > Yes, we worked consistently, pushing commits almost every day and ensuring that each modification 
      did not impact on the functionality of other components.

- **Did you deliver business value and what was it?**
    > Yes, we successfully implemented a UI with API calls that accurately retrieve and display data from Taiga,enhanching the project's functionality and user experience.

- **Did you follow the Scrum process (e.g., moving tasks, updating boards, etc.)?**
    > Yes, we followed the Scrum process by consistently updating the Scrum board and maintaining clear 
      communication within the team. This helped us avoid conflicts when merging changes across different 
      User Stories and Pull Requests.

- **Is there anything you could improve for the next Sprint? (For the last Sprint mention what you would do if you were to continue)**
    > Yes, we could implement additional API calls to retrieve more data for the other UIs we developed. Additionally, we could improve test coverage by creating more test cases for both the UI implementations and API calls.

- **How do you feel about the Sprint? (Team optimism pulse)**
    > Overall, this Sprint was both challenging and ambitious, but we successfully completed the User Stories to the best of our abilities. We delivered a product that effectively demonstrates our vision for the project: integrating Taiga’s API to display data accurately.

### Burndown Chart (For Sprint 2 and 3):
![alt text](image.png) 
- **Analysis of Burndown**: _Why does it look like this? What would you improve?_

> As mentioned in our Sprint Retrospective, we underestimated the time required to implement the UIs and    expand the API calls. To improve this in future sprints, we should break tasks down into smaller, more manageable units. For example, one sprint could focus solely on UI implementation and data presentation, while a subsequent sprint could focus on integrating Taiga’s API into the UIs. This approach would help us better define each User Story and task, leading to a more accurate estimation of the time required for each.
