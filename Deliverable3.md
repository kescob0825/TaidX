## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review (Answer as a team)
#### Screen Cast Link:  
- [Youtube Link] (Link here)

#### Sprint Review Questions:
- **What value did you create during this Sprint?**
    > We made the application dynamic, added support for the burndown chart, created a sprint interface and an issues
    > interface to allow the end user to interact with the application.

- **Do you feel you worked enough and met expectations?**
    > Yes, we met the sprint goal and created an application that looks and feels nothing like the original memoranda app.
    > it has completely evolved into a usable application.

- **Did you meet the customers’ expectations? Why or why not?**
    > If the customer wanted an application to work on team planning and sprint related tasks, then yes. For one scrum round,
    > our team accomplished just that. Given more time the application could be refined but this is a beta ready application.

---

### Sprint Retrospective (Answer as a team, based on evidence)
Provide clear answers based on your team’s actual data and performance.

- **Did you meet your Sprint Goal?**

    > Yes, we cleared out the backlog and got the application ready for a beta launch.

- **Did you complete all User Stories in the Sprint Backlog?**
    > Yes, see burndown chart and product backlog.

- **If not, what went wrong?**
    > We completed our goal but the unit testing and CR's were lacking.

- **Did you work at a consistent rate or velocity?**
    > 27 tasks (25 completed, 2 remaining) 27 and counting commits for sprint 3.

- **Did you deliver business value and what was it?**
    > The application is beta ready for a soft launch. We tested as much as we could. Now it is ready for the end user to use it and provide feedback.

- **Did you follow the Scrum process (e.g., moving tasks, updating boards, etc.)?**
    > Yes, boards were reviewed and updated each meeting. The team talked about obstacles and plans to overcome them. Collaboration was ample for those that attended meetings.

- **Is there anything you could improve for the next Sprint? (For the last Sprint mention what you would do if you were to continue)**
    > Soft launch the app and get user/customer feedback. Use that to plan the next course of action.

- **How do you feel about the Sprint? (Team optimism pulse)**
    > Glad this is the last sprint.
